# Database Initialization System - Implementation Summary

## Overview
Replaced the fragile retry-on-error pattern throughout the codebase with a robust, centralized database initialization system that runs once on startup or can be triggered via HTTP endpoints.

## Changes Made

### 1. New DatabaseInitializationService
**File:** `Services/DatabaseInitializationService.cs`

A centralized service that handles all database table management:

**Key Features:**
- **DropAllTablesAsync()**: Safely drops all application tables
- **InitializeDatabaseAsync()**: Creates all tables by calling EnsureSchema on each service
- **TestDatabaseAsync()**: Verifies all tables exist in system schema
- **FullInitializationCycleAsync()**: Complete workflow - drop → create → test
- **IsInitialized**: Property to track initialization status

**Tables Managed:**
- person2, person_data
- place, place_data
- thing, thing_data, thing_by_owner
- event, event_data
- relationship, relationship_by_from, relationship_by_to, relationship_type
- search_entry
- share_invitation, share_invitation_by_recipient
- data_provenance, data_conflict
- document, document_link, document_by_entity, storage_quota
- source_citation, citation_by_source, conflicting_information

### 2. Updated AdminController
**File:** `Controllers/AdminController.cs`

Added new HTTP endpoints for database management:

- `POST /api/admin/drop-all-tables` - Drop all tables (requires auth)
- `POST /api/admin/initialize-database?force=true` - Initialize/recreate database (requires auth)
- `POST /api/admin/test-database` - Test database by verifying table existence (requires auth)
- `POST /api/admin/full-initialization-cycle` - Complete drop/create/test cycle (requires auth)
- `GET /api/admin/initialization-status` - Check if database is initialized

### 3. Updated Program.cs
**File:** `Program.cs`

Changes to startup sequence:
- Registered `DatabaseInitializationService` in DI container
- Calls `InitializeDatabaseAsync()` on startup (before accepting requests)
- Commented out old `MigrationRunner` approach (kept for backwards compatibility)

### 4. Removed Retry Logic from Services
**Files Modified:**
- `Services/ThingService.cs`
- `Services/EventService.cs`
- `Services/PlaceService.cs`
- `Services/RelationshipService.cs`
- `Services/ShareService.cs`
- `Services/DocumentService.cs`
- `Services/SourceCitationService.cs`
- `Persons/PersonService.cs`
- `Search/SearchService.cs`

**Changes:**
- Removed all `try-catch` blocks that caught `InvalidQueryException` for "unconfigured table"
- Removed all calls to `EnsureSchema()` within query methods
- Removed all retry logic and `SchemaHelper.WaitForTables()` calls from query methods
- Services now assume tables exist (created on startup)

### 5. Service EnsureSchema Methods
**Kept Intact:**
All `EnsureSchema()` methods in services remain unchanged. They are now called centrally by `DatabaseInitializationService` rather than being invoked on-demand during queries.

## Usage

### On Startup
The application automatically initializes the database when it starts:
```csharp
var (success, message) = await dbInitService.InitializeDatabaseAsync();
```

### Manual Initialization
Using the admin endpoints (requires authentication):

```bash
# Check initialization status
curl -X GET http://localhost:5000/api/admin/initialization-status \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_TOKEN"

# Initialize database (force recreate)
curl -X POST http://localhost:5000/api/admin/initialize-database?force=true \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_TOKEN"

# Test database
curl -X POST http://localhost:5000/api/admin/test-database \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_TOKEN"

# Full cycle: drop → create → test
curl -X POST http://localhost:5000/api/admin/full-initialization-cycle \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_TOKEN"
```

### Development Workflow
For iterative development with schema changes:

1. **Drop all tables:**
   ```bash
   curl -X POST http://localhost:5000/api/admin/drop-all-tables \
     -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_TOKEN"
   ```

2. **Make schema changes in service EnsureSchema methods**

3. **Reinitialize:**
   ```bash
   curl -X POST http://localhost:5000/api/admin/initialize-database?force=true \
     -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_TOKEN"
   ```

4. **Test:**
   ```bash
   curl -X POST http://localhost:5000/api/admin/test-database \
     -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_TOKEN"
   ```

Or use the all-in-one endpoint:
```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:5000/api/admin/full-initialization-cycle \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_TOKEN"
```

## Benefits

### 1. Reliability
- Tables are created once on startup, not lazily on first query
- No race conditions from concurrent table creation attempts
- Predictable initialization sequence

### 2. Performance
- Eliminated retry loops that added latency to queries
- No schema validation overhead on every query
- Cleaner, faster query execution paths

### 3. Maintainability
- Centralized table management
- Clear separation: initialization vs. querying
- Easier to debug initialization issues
- Single source of truth for table list

### 4. Developer Experience
- Easy to reset database state during development
- Clear HTTP endpoints for database operations
- Comprehensive test endpoint to verify table existence
- Full initialization cycle for complete reset

### 5. Production Ready
- Initialization happens before accepting requests
- Failed initialization is logged and can be monitored
- Can manually trigger reinitialization if needed
- Authorization required for destructive operations

## Migration Notes

### From Old System
The old retry-based pattern:
```csharp
try {
    var result = await _table.Where(...).ExecuteAsync();
} catch (InvalidQueryException ex) when (ex.Message.Contains("unconfigured table")) {
    EnsureSchema();
    SchemaHelper.WaitForTables(...);
    var result = await _table.Where(...).ExecuteAsync(); // retry
}
```

New simplified pattern:
```csharp
var result = await _table.Where(...).ExecuteAsync();
```

Tables are guaranteed to exist because `DatabaseInitializationService` ran on startup.

### Backwards Compatibility
- `MigrationRunner` service is kept but disabled by default
- All `EnsureSchema()` methods remain in services
- Can switch back by uncommenting MigrationRunner code in Program.cs

## Testing

After running the full initialization cycle, you should see results like:
```json
{
  "success": true,
  "message": "Full initialization cycle completed successfully",
  "details": {
    "dropped_tables": ["person2", "place", "thing", ...],
    "drop_failures": [],
    "initialization_message": "Database initialized successfully",
    "test_results": {
      "person2": "OK - Table exists",
      "place": "OK - Table exists",
      "thing": "OK - Table exists",
      ...
    }
  }
}
```

## Future Enhancements

Potential improvements:
1. Add actual data insertion/retrieval tests (currently only checks table existence)
2. Add schema version tracking
3. Add migration support for schema changes
4. Add rollback capability
5. Add table size/statistics monitoring
6. Add backup/restore endpoints
